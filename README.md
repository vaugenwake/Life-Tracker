Life Tracker
===========================

## What am I trying to do?
1. Find a way to collect data throught my day about my mood, energy, eating, fitness and other life factors into a database of spreadsheet
2. Report my life on a Dashboard to see how I behave with different things that happen throught the day
3. Build out habbit tracker that looks at my day and adjusts or reminds me of the goals I set to achieve. Based on how the day is panning out
4. Provide a breakdown of the data in the evening and a overview of what I need to adjust the next day.

## Possible options to look at:
* Collecting data through a chat bot or automated script thoughout the day
    * Look at how to build a chat bot to send messages throughout the day with data I need to complete.
    * Using a combination of forms or 1 phrase answers to quickly reply to questions form my mobile like a simple text message.
* Use a much free tools to report and collect data as possible: Slack, Google Data & Sheets, IFTT, Zappier

## Things that will stop this from working:
- If there is to much friction in the data collection process. (Realistically I wont input the data if it takes longer than 1sec to get to the data input mechenism, mobile apps and things similar are to slow to open to keep me engaged)
- If the API's for data are closed. (Off the shelf apps like MyFitnessPal and habit trackers have closed APIs, May need to setup scripts to import the data on a cron)
- If the data entry is always manual and there is no reminder mechenism. (It will need to integrate with notifications and basic alerts on my devices so as to not interupt my day.)
